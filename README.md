# leaflet-challenge

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 

The purpose of this activity is to develop a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.


Instructions
The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts: (Part 2 (optional) was not completed, so I did not upload it) 

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

The first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:

1) To get the dataset, we follow the below steps: 

> 1. The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON FeedLinks to an external site and choose a dataset to extract as a JSON.

2) The next step is to Import and visualize the data by doing the following:

> 1. Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

> 2. The map has 2 views: Street and Topographic

> 3. The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

>4. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

>5. Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.

This is the final output visual:
